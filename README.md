# Customer-Loyalty-Analytics

The Client is a grocery retailer who is looking to expand their footprint to 75 more stores national wide. The Client aims to conduct a customer analytics to gain insight into preferences, improve revenue and become competitive with their marketing in their new locations. Main purpose of this study is to improve the marketing and loyalty functions to provide more offers and increase share of wallet and customer lifetime value (LTV). We employed EDA, and predictive model to help company achieve their goals. 
This project has been done in three phases:
 1. Sample Analysis to gain insight about overall picture, get familiar with dataset, and run a preliminary analysis. 
 2. Get data from Amazon RDS and Analysis the full set of data, create cohort table and apply customer segmentation with regards to frequency, recency and monetary related parameters. Find the main drives for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), and utilize a primary feature selection for modeling
3.  Apply machine learning for product and customer classification, customer clustering and compare the results with analytical segmentations done in previous phase. Applied predictive model to forecast churn rate and suggest preventive or incentive considerations to increase retention and CLTV. 

#Project Overview

The Customer Loyalty Analysis Project was conducted for a grocery retailer seeking to expand its presence by opening 75 new stores nationwide. The primary objective of this project was to enhance customer insights, optimize revenue generation, and bolster marketing competitiveness in new locations. The focus was on improving marketing strategies and loyalty programs to provide more attractive offers and increase both the share of wallet and customer lifetime value (CLTV). The project employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling to assist the company in achieving its objectives.
Project Phases
#Phase 1: Sample Analysis

In the initial phase, we conducted a sample analysis to gain an overall understanding of the dataset, familiarize ourselves with the data, and perform preliminary analyses. This phase allowed us to lay the foundation for deeper insights in subsequent stages.
#Phase 2: Full Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation

The second phase involved acquiring data from Amazon RDS and conducting a comprehensive analysis of the entire dataset. We created a cohort table and applied customer segmentation techniques, considering factors such as frequency, recency, and monetary values. The objective was to identify the key drivers for Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and perform primary feature selection for modeling purposes.
#Phase 3: Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling

In the final phase, we leveraged machine learning techniques for product and customer classification. Additionally, we conducted customer clustering to compare the results with analytical segmentations from the previous phase. The project culminated in the application of predictive models to forecast churn rates and provide recommendations for preventive measures or incentives to enhance customer retention and CLTV.
#Conclusion

The Customer Loyalty Analysis Project served as a strategic initiative to empower our client with data-driven insights that are crucial for their expansion plans. By systematically analyzing sales, supplier, and customer data, we have provided actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer loyalty, and drive revenue growth. This project underscores the power of data analytics in shaping business strategies and ensuring long-term success in a competitive retail landscape.
